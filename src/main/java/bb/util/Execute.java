Programmer notes:

--after working with this class, I am a bit unhappy when you use it inside a main method:
	--the resulting code can be a little too wordy:
		--its annoying to have to see all the Callable/Runnable packaging code
		--there can be many indentations and curly braces
	--DO ALL THESE CONCERNS GO AWAY ONCE CAN USE THE NEW JAVA CLOSURES (now due in jdk 8...)?
		http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-state-2.html
	--until we get closures, I have spent some time thinking about alternative ways to implement/use this class.
	I think that the best approach is to intercept on the command line code that want wrapped with this class's functionality.
		--usage would look like:
			java Exec some.classname <normal args>
			java ExecThenExit some.classname <normal args>
			java ExecOnEdt some.classname <normal args>
		--how it works:
			--need to write 3 new classes (above used the default package), each of which will:
				--create a Class for the fully qualified class name (some.classname above)
				--create a Runnable which invokes its main method with the remaining command line args (<normal args> above)
				--call the appropriate method of this Execute class
		--pros:
			--could trivially add/remove Execute's functionality for any class with no programming, just doing script or IDE configuration
		--cons:
			--only works with main (or, would need to add support for specifying some other method)
			--Execute's functionality, not being written into the class, might be all too easy to be overlooked

/**
* Executes a "task",
* defined here as arbitrary Java code that is contained inside either a {@link Callable} or {@link Runnable} instance.
* <p>
* The following always occurs:
* <ol>
*  <li>
*		assigns a new {@link UncaughtThrowableLogger} to {@link Thread#setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler Thread},
*		which ensures that every uncaught Throwable is properly logged.
*		Note that this assignment will remain for the life of the JVM, unless subsequently changed by other code.
*  </li>
*  <li>logs the task's start and stop dates, as well as the total execution time</li>
*  <li>ensures that any Throwable raised by the task is either logged or rethrown as a RuntimeException</li>
* </ol>
* Additionally, the following may/may not occur, depending on what method of this class is called (see each method's javadocs for details):
* <ol>
*  <li>
*		executes the task on {@link EventQueue}'s {@link EventQueue#isDispatchThread dispatch thread}
*		instead of the calling thread (this is required by Java GUI components)
*  </li>
*  <li>plays an appropriate sound, depending on whether task finishes normally or abnormally</li>
*  <li>forces the JVM to exit with an appropriate exit code, depending on whether task finishes normally or abnormally</li>
* </ol>
* <p>
* This functionality is exposed via static methods like
* {@link #thenContinue(Callable) thenContinue}, {@link #thenExitIfEntryPoint(Callable) thenExitIfEntryPoint}, {@link #usingEdt(Callable) usingEdt}.
* <p>
* The original motivation of this class was to simplify and standardize the implementation of <code>main</code> methods,
* since they often require the same boilerplate code (the functionality described above).
* One way to write a (non-GUI) <code>main</code> method using this class is:
* <pre><code>
	&#47;**
	* ...
	* <p>
	* If this method is this Java process's entry point (i.e. first <code>main</code> method),
	* then its final action is a call to {@link System#exit System.exit}, which means that <i>this method never returns</i>;
	* its exit code is 0 if it executes normally, 1 if it throws a Throwable (which will be caught and logged).
	* Otherwise, this method returns and leaves the JVM running.
	*&#47;
	public static void main(final String[] args) {
		Execute.thenExitIfEntryPoint( new Callable<Void>() { public Void call() throws Exception {
			// insert here whatever specific code your main is supposed to do
			return null;
		} } );
	}
* </code></pre>
* If the purpose is to launch a GUI, then this form almost certainly should be used:
* <pre><code>
	&#47;**
	* Creates a GUI and then returns.
	*&#47;
	public static void main(final String[] args) {
		Execute.usingEdt( new Runnable() { public void run() {
			// insert here whatever specific code your main is supposed to do
		} } );
	}
* </code></pre>
* <p>
* Concerning the execution time that is always logged by this class:
* it can serve as a quick and dirty benchmark only if
* a) task runs long enough that a single execution yields an accurate execution time
* and b) you do not care about execution statistics (i.e. means, standard deviations, confidence intervals).
* For all serious benchmarking needs, use {@link Benchmark}.
* Here is an example of how some quick benchmarks may be obtained:
* <pre><code>
	&#47;**
	* Benchmarks a series of tasks; see the logs (files and/or console) for results.
	*&#47;
	public static void main(final String[] args) {
		Execute.thenContinue( new Runnable() { public void run() {
			// insert here code for task #1
		} } );
		
		Execute.thenContinue( new Runnable() { public void run() {
			// insert here code for task #2
		} } );
		
		// etc...
	}
* </code></pre>
* <p>
* This class is multithread safe: its public api is static methods which use no shared state.
* (Its instance state is completely encapsulated, and is mostly immutable or thread safe).
* <p>
